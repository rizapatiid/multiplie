## Core Features:

- Import CSV Data: Import music distribution data from CSV files.
- Tabular Data View: Display data in a tabular format.
- Platform Summary: Provide summary statistics for each distribution platform.
- Revenue Insights: Use generative AI to analyze royalty statements to suggest how artists can grow revenue or cut expenses. The AI is used as a tool; use its advice at your own risk.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light Indigo (#9FA8DA) for a modern and clean feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a very desaturated tint of the primary, for a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted Purple (#B39DDB), which is analogous to the primary and stands out subtly.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, because they complement each other with a modern, technical feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalistic icons to represent different music platforms.
- Use a clean and well-spaced layout to present the data effectively.
- Subtle transitions when switching between data views or importing data.
